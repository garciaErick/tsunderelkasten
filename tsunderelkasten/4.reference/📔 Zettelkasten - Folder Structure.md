## Note Types
### Definitions
#### 1. Fleeting Notes
These are short, spontaneous ideas or thoughts that come to mind. They are often quickly jotted down without too much structure and serve as temporary notes. The goal is to capture ideas immediately so you can process or discard them later. These notes are not intended to be kept permanently but are a way to capture inspiration or thoughts on the go.
##### Types of fleeting Notes
- **Daily**: Notes or observations captured daily.
- **Weekly**: Summarized or reflective notes from the week.
- **Monthly**: Highlights and learnings from the month.
- **Yearly**: Annual reflections or summaries.
#### 2. Literature Notes
- **Purpose**: Notes taken from books, articles, podcasts, or videos. These can literally be a copy paste, its the purpose of a literature note
##### Types of Literature Notes
- Key quotes
- Summaries
- Personal insights or critiques
#### 3. Permanent Notes
- Purpose: Refined, long-term notes based on fleeting or literature notes. These have to be a condensed thought in your own words, no copy paste.
- Should represent actionable knowledge or ideas.
- Example: A note titled "Principles of Flexibility Training."
#### 4. Reference Notes
- Purpose: Usually a reference material, can be all sorts of things. What helps me identify the difference between reference and structure notes, is that I think of a reference not as  something that will not change much overtime as opposed to a project.
- Example: I have some examples already here such as exercises, exercise guides, recipes, etc.
#### 5. Structured Notes
- Purpose: Organize specific projects or goals into a clear structure.
- Example: "Flexibility Goals" could serve as a structured note where you:
    - Define your goals.
    - Track progress.
    - Link related notes like "Split Flexibility Techniques."
